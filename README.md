# Tak-game:
This is my final project for Artificial intelligence course.
In this project, I implemented TAK game with Prolog programming language.
## Game condition
At the beginning of the game, the screen is empty and each player in turn can perform one of the following moves:
1. Put his colored seal in one of the empty cells of the table.
2. Place the colored bead on the previous beads in a non-empty table cell.
3. Select one of the non-empty cells of the table whose highest vertex is in its own color and select the vertices of that cell.
Move the table to other cells while maintaining order.
The winner of the game is the one who creates a path between one of the opposite sides of the playing field with his colored beads.
• The maximum height of each house is 8 beads.
• All the said movements are only for the neighboring houses on the side with the house where the player is the same color as the player.
It is possible.
